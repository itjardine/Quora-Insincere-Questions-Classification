# Quora Insincere Questions Classification

This is a repository for the Jupyter notebook that I wrote and submitted for the Kaggle competition on classifying toxic Quora questions. The notebook cannot be run without the data, which I unfortunately cannot load here due to the competition rules. Please take a look at the [Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification).

This was my first foray into neural networks beyond the very simple dense networks. There are a lot of things that could likely be improved but I have left this here for posterityâ€™s sake. I have changed a few of the comments in the notebook but the code remains unchanged from the Kaggle competition.
